# Arduino-Smart-Blinds


This program will help you control your blinds by opening, closing or opening half way.
               This can be done through the website (192.168.0.45) or you can set it to automatically close, open and open half way depending on the amount of light outside.
               Automatic control is setup so that the room remains cool. i.e Will close if it's very bright, will open if dark and open half way if there is some light.
